<h3>Why Tokyo?</h3>
<h2>Tokyo, Japan's major cultural centre</h2>
<p>Tokyo is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center. The site of Tokyo has been inhabited since ancient times; the small fishing village of Edo existed there for centuries. Edo’s development into a city did not occur until the Tokugawa period (1603–1867), when it became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, which ended the shogunate, the capital was moved to Edo. The city was renamed Tokyo, meaning “eastern capital.” Tokyo’s population exceeded one million in the late 19th century, and it became one of the world’s most populous cities in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Tokyo offers a large choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. The city's history can be seen in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent museums, historic temples and gardens. Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city center.</p>
